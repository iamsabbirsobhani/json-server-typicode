Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.., comes from a line in section 1.10.32.",

      "body": "A friend once contacted me asking if I had a way to dynamically change one HTML element into another within Vue‚Äôs template block. For instance, shifting a <div> element to a <span> element based on some criteria. The trick was to do this without relying on a series of v-if and v-else code.\n\nI didn‚Äôt think much of it because I couldn‚Äôt see a strong reason to do such a thing; it just doesn‚Äôt come up that often. Later that same day, though, he reached out again and told me he learned how to change element types. He excitedly pointed out that Vue has a built-in component that can be used as a dynamic element in the very way that he needed.\n\nThis small feature can keep code in the template nice and tidy. It can reduce v-if and v-else glut down to a smaller amount of code that‚Äôs easier to understand and maintain. This allows us to use methods or computed methods to create nicely-coded, and yet more elaborate, conditions in the script block. That‚Äôs where such things belong: in the script, not the template block.\n\nI had the idea for this article mainly because we use this feature in several places in the design system where I work. Granted it‚Äôs not a huge feature and it is barely mentioned in the documentation, at least as far as I can tell. Yet it has potential to help render specific HTML elements in components.\n\nlink: https://css-tricks.com/dynamically-switching-from-one-html-element-to-another-in-vue/",

But considering you‚Äôd probably be using it within your own app, it should be style-able so it can incorporated nicely anywhere. How to allow that styling isn‚Äôt exactly obvious:\n\nWhat wasn‚Äôt obvious to me, though, was how to allow users to style it. What if they wanted a difnks to the pseudo selectors, like :host(.dark) { background: black; }.\nShadow parts: You add attributes to things you want to be style-able, like <span part=\"foo\">, then CSS from the outside can reach in like custom-component::part(foo) { }.\nUser forced: Despite the nothing in/nothing out vibe of the Shadow DOM, you can always reach the element.shadowRoot and inject a <style>, so there is always a way to get styles in.\nIt‚Äôs probably worth a mention that the DOM you slot into place is style-able from ‚Äúoutside‚Äù CSS as it were.\n\nThis is such a funky problem. I like the Shadow DOM because it‚Äôs the closest thing we have on the web platform to scoped style.\n\n",
